Sound extension- Everytime the ball hits a brick, a sound is created. 
In addition,we varied the sounds. I placed sound objects in a list and used random module to vary the sounds played.

In addition , we created a countdown clock in our breakout module. Ex: 3,2,1
This was done in a countdown helper function.
